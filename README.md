# 🚀 C++ Practice Sheet – Striver CP Sheet Solutions

This repository contains my **C++ implementations** of problems from the **Striver CP Sheet**, written with clean structure, comments, and optimized approaches.

The goal of this project is to:
- Build strong problem-solving skills  
- Practice competitive programming consistently  
- Maintain high-quality, revisitable solutions  
- Track my progress through the entire Striver CP roadmap  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each problem will have:
- A **C++ solution file**
- **Approach / intuition**
- **Time & space complexity**
- Sometimes sample inputs or test cases

Folder layout will follow the Striver CP topics:
```
Arrays/
Binary Search/
Greedy/
DP/
Graphs/
Trees/
Number Theory/
String Algorithms/
Two-Pointers/
Sliding Window/
Segment Trees/
Miscellaneous/
```

## 🎯 Objectives of This Repo
- Strengthen competitive programming fundamentals  
- Prepare for contests (Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, LeetCode)  
- Build a reusable, polished collection of CP templates and solutions  
- Become consistent with coding practice  
- Make revision fast and structured  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++ (C++17/20)
- **Build:** g++, clang
- **Mode:** Competitive Programming (fast IO, STL usage)

---

## 📘 How to Use This Repo
1. Pick a problem from the Striver CP Sheet  
2. Open the corresponding folder  
3. Read the approach explanation  
4. Go through the C++ solution  
5. Try solving the problem yourself  

---

## 💡 Coding Style & Practices
- Uses fast I/O  
- Clean code with comments  
- STL-heavy approach (`vector`, `map`, `set`, `priority_queue`, etc.)  
- Tries to achieve optimal time complexity  
- Includes edge cases & notes  

---

## 🏆 Aim
To complete the **entire Striver CP Sheet** with properly documented solutions and build a strong foundation for competitive programming.
